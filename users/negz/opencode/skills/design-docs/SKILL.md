name: design-docs
description: Write and review software design documents to the Upbound style - proposals, RFCs, architecture and design docs for any project (Crossplane, Modelplane, internal services). Use when drafting, authoring, or structuring a design doc, and when reviewing, refactoring, tightening, or cleaning up someone else's design doc, especially an AI-written one that reads poorly. Also use when asked whether a design doc is good, or to bring one up to the standard of a gold-standard example.

# Design docs: the Upbound style

A design doc exists to win agreement on a problem and a proposed solution. Its
readers are peer maintainers who know the project the doc concerns. They often
will not know the problem itself, nor the technical area around it. That area
might be anything from a serving engine to a wire protocol. A good design doc
gives that reader the problem, the case that the proposal solves it, and the
alternatives it beat. They should finish it ready to approve the direction or
push back on it.

Everything here serves that reader. A rule that rests only on convention or an
author's taste is not in this skill.

## When to Use This (vs other skills)

Use **this skill** for the structure and content of a design doc: whether it
frames its problem, argues its solution, and handles its alternatives well. It
applies both to writing one from scratch and to fixing a poor one.

Use **writing-style** for sentence-level voice and the AI-tell linting pass. A doc
that fixes its structure can still read AI, so clear the writing-style vale and
de-slop pass before calling the doc done.

Use **scratch-docs** for where a doc belongs and how to open its PR.

## The Standard

These describe a good design doc. They double as the rubric to score one against,
and the checklist to refactor one toward.

1. **Leads with the problem.** The reader reaches the proposal already
   understanding the problem. A proposal makes sense only against a problem the
   reader already feels. Open with the solution and they read the rest working out
   what it is for.

2. **Stands alone.** Everything the argument rests on is in the doc. Links,
   in-repo or out, are optional depth the reader may follow but never has to. A
   design that makes sense only once you have also read an issue, a PR, or a review
   thread has put its content where the reader may never go.

3. **Covers the domain, assumes the project.** Write for a maintainer who knows
   the project but not the problem space. Explain the one property the proposal
   rests on, and no more. A peer new to the area cannot buy into a problem stated
   in its terms, and spelling out what a maintainer already knows wastes them.

4. **Reads as the end state, in the present tense.** Describe the design as the
   first and only position, not the latest of several. Document status (`draft`,
   `accepted`) is fine. A record of how the code got here is not: no "proven but
   unmerged", no proof-of-concept branch name, no "this replaces an earlier
   approach". That history makes the reader reconstruct the past instead of reading
   the design. Discarded thinking goes to Alternatives, gathered there rather than
   scattered inline.

5. **Mechanics in broad strokes, API and UX in full.** Show the interface a user
   or caller touches: the YAML they write, the API shapes they see, the command
   they run, and the response they get. Show it with real, whole examples. Keep the
   internals of a controller, function, or pipeline out. The doc drives direction
   and buy-in, and internals only distract from that. They belong in the repo,
   where they stay current.

6. **Proportion.** A section's size matches its importance to the whole doc, not
   how recently it came up or how much the author enjoyed it. Readers weigh a topic
   by the room it gets, so an oversized section misleads them. A background or
   future-work section that dwarfs the proposal points to a problem to fix.

7. **Takes a position on everything it records.** Give the reviewer something
   concrete to approve or push back on. A point worth recording at design-doc level
   gets a position. A point the team could approve and settle later is not worth
   recording, so leave it out. Do not add an Open Questions section,
   which an LLM above all will fill with invented questions, and do not pose
   questions to the reader. When a choice is close, pick one and put the runner-up
   in Alternatives.

8. **Alternatives honest and in their section.** Each real alternative, the current
   system included, gets a fair account. Say what it is and what is good about it,
   then why the proposal wins anyway. No strawmen, and no arguing an objection
   inline where it breaks the thread. A reader who wonders "why not X?" should find
   X in one place.

9. **Examples real and whole.** Reuse a tested artifact, show the whole object
   rather than a fragment, and carry one example through the doc. An example does
   more for the reader than the prose around it, and a fabricated one misleads
   because its detail invites trust. When you cannot build a credible one, say so
   rather than invent.

10. **As short as the three jobs allow.** Frame the problem, argue the solution,
    cover the alternatives, then stop. Remove any paragraph the reader does not
    need. Length costs the reader time, and it buries the argument. A design for one
    feature that runs past roughly twice the length of a tight peer design is a
    finding. Either it covers a large domain, or it is over-produced, so justify it
    or cut it.

## Authoring

Before writing, settle who the doc is for and what decision it serves. Name the
problem space the reader will not know, and state what falls outside the doc's
scope. Ask rather than guess.

Then follow the skeleton. Most docs use some of it. Drop any section with nothing
to say.

1. **Title.** Short and descriptive. Derive it again at the end from what the doc
   argues.
2. **Status, date, author.** `draft` or `accepted`, the date, and who wrote it. Use
   "I" for one author, "we" for co-authors.
3. **Summary** (longer docs). A few paragraphs that give the whole picture, so a
   busy reader can stop there with the problem and the proposal clear. Put the
   primary example here.
4. **Background.** The problem, what stands today, and the prior art. This is where
   the doc leads with the problem (standard 1) and covers the domain (standard 3).
5. **Goals.** What the doc delivers, and what it leaves out. A few bullets, stated
   positively.
6. **Proposal.** The concrete design. Show the API and UX in full (standard 5),
   with a worked example per case, including the awkward one.
7. **Future improvements** (optional). Out of scope now, plausible later. All
   speculative material belongs here, and stays proportional (standard 6).
8. **Alternatives considered.** What else you weighed, and why it lost (standard 8).

Write the background as the story of how we got here and why the status quo fits
poorly now, so the reader reaches the proposal already feeling the problem. Cover
only the property the proposal rests on. Respect what came before: name the
shortcoming and the new constraint that exposes it, without calling the old system
bad.

Then cut and de-slop. A first draft runs long. Cut once for what the reader can
reconstruct, then again for what remains. Trade paragraphs of prose for a worked
example wherever one carries the point. Run vale over the whole doc and a
fresh-context de-slop review, and fix both until they come back clean.

## Refactoring

Refactoring a poor doc, often an AI-written one, is surgery on the document's shape
more than a copy edit. Read it against the standard before touching it, and write
the diagnosis down: for each point, whether it holds and where it fails. That
record is the before-state, and the feedback for the author. A fresh reader catches
what the author and the drafting agent cannot, so run the diagnosis from a fresh
context, or have another agent do it, briefed with the standard and one strong
example.

Fix the structure before the prose, in this order, because fixing a sentence you
later cut wastes effort:

1. **Buried or missing problem** (standard 1). Lift the sharp problem statement
   into the opening of the background. If it sits only in the PR description, move
   it into the doc.
2. **Internals where API and UX belong** (standard 5). Cut controller and pipeline
   internals to broad strokes, and keep the interface whole. Usually the largest
   cut.
3. **Leaked chronology** (standard 4). Rewrite to the present-tense end state, and
   move a discarded design to Alternatives.
4. **Off proportion** (standard 6). Cut the oversized section, then its neighbours.
5. **The doc argues with itself or a reviewer** (standards 4 and 8). Move the
   substance to Alternatives and rewrite the section positively, from first
   principles.
6. **Open questions or hedged non-decisions** (standard 7). Make the call, or cut
   the point if it does not warrant one.
7. **Thin or unfair alternatives** (standard 8). Give each a fair account and an
   honest reason it lost.
8. **Fabricated or fragmentary examples** (standard 9). Replace with a real, whole
   object.

Prefer surgery to a rewrite. Keep the author's structure and content and move it
where you can, so the author still recognises the doc. A section built on a framing
error usually needs redoing from first principles, because patched prose drifts
into incoherence.

Then de-slop, and do not skip it. Run vale and a fresh-context de-slop review, and
loop until both come back clean. A doc that meets the standard
but reads as though an LLM wrote it is not done.

Prove it improved. Score the refactor against the standard again, blind where you
can, giving a fresh agent the rubric and a strong example without saying which
version is which. The refactor succeeds when it scores at or above the exemplar on
the same rubric the diagnosis used.
