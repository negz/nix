# Voice and Structure

What the target looks like, drawn from ~30 of Nic's documents spanning
2019-2025. Read this when drafting from scratch. The failure modes in SKILL.md
matter more, because they describe where drafts actually go wrong. This file
describes where they should end up.

## Voice

### First person, direct

Write in first person. "I propose…", "I believe…", "I think…", "I'd argue…".
State positions plainly instead of hedging behind passive voice or committee
language. The reader should always know what the author thinks and why.

Use "I" rather than a collective "we" for anything he authored. Where uncertain,
say so ("I'm not sure how real or widespread these concerns are", "I suspect…")
while still taking a position.

### Conversational authority

The tone is an experienced engineer talking to peers. Informal enough for
contractions and for phrases like "a lot of", "pretty complex", "not so bad".
Rigorous enough for precise technical detail, concrete numbers, and YAML.

<!-- vale off -->
Avoid corporate voice ("leverage synergies", "drive alignment"), academic voice
("it is posited that"), and stacked hedges ("it might perhaps be worth
considering").
<!-- vale on -->

### Empathy for the reader

Assume a smart reader who lacks your context. Give enough background for
somebody joining the conversation, without over-explaining what peers know.
Where a concept surprised you, say so, then explain what made it click.

Take care with `obvious`, `obviously`, `clearly`, and `of course`. What's
obvious to a senior engineer often isn't obvious to a junior one, and these
words risk making a reader feel bad for not already knowing. This isn't a hard
ban, since some things really are obvious. Default to stating the thing rather
than editorialising about how apparent it should be.

Use analogies to connect unfamiliar ideas to familiar ones. "An MRD is to an MR
CRD as an XRD is to an XR CRD." "Think of this like AWS Lambda." "`flake.nix` is
a bit like a Makefile backed by a snapshot of nixpkgs."

## Structure

### Standard sections

Most documents follow this skeleton, though few use all of it:

1. **Title.** Short, descriptive, re-derived at the end from what the document
   argues.
2. **Author and date.** "Nic Cope, Month Day, Year".
3. **Executive summary** (longer docs). A few paragraphs giving the whole
   picture, so a busy reader can stop there. Include the primary example here.
4. **Background.** What the reader needs to follow the proposal, including
   prior art and the problem.
5. **Goals.** What the document tries to achieve, and what falls outside it.
6. **Proposal.** The concrete design.
7. **Workstreams** or **Migration plan** (optional). What makes it real.
8. **Future improvements** (optional). Out of scope now, plausible later. This
   is where speculative material belongs.
9. **Alternatives considered.** What else was evaluated, and why it lost.

Shorter one-pagers skip the executive summary and run background, proposal,
alternatives. Drop any section with nothing to say.

There is no Open Questions section. See SKILL.md.

### Front-load the destination

Before the background starts building the case, give the reader a sentence or
two saying where this goes. It can close a brief introduction or open the
executive summary. Knowing the thesis turns the background from "where is this
going?" into "I see why this matters".

### Background tells a story

Background sections run long relative to their neighbours, because they carry
the narrative of how we got here and what changed. They link out to
prior work so the reader can go deeper. A good one has the reader nodding along,
thinking "yes, I see why this is a problem", before the proposal starts.

Long is not the same as padded. Every paragraph still has to do work, and the
section still gets both cutting passes. Where the background outgrows the rest of
the document by a wide margin, that's a finding.

Background also needs the case that forced the decision. Where prefill/decode
disaggregation was the litmus test for a new shape, the background covers it.
Showing the status quo in YAML often beats describing it.

### Goals are crisp

Goals sections are short, a few bullets or a brief paragraph. They state what's
in scope and what isn't. "It's not a goal to…" appears often.

Pitch goals at project level rather than at a release, and state them positively,
as what gets delivered. Keep build detail out. Goals also frame
ambition: "My goal with this document is to sketch out…" sets different
expectations from "The goal of this proposal is to have Upbound Crossplane
install only the CRDs customers actually use."

### Proposals are concrete

Proposals include YAML, protobuf, API specs, and diagrams. Show the API rather
than describing it. Walk through the user experience step by step:

<!-- vale off -->
> Assume you've installed provider-aws-ec2 with mrdActivationPolicy: Manual…
> You then install a Configuration that depends on provider-aws-ec2. The
> Configuration would consider its dependency satisfied, because the Provider is
> installed. The Configuration wouldn't be usable though…
<!-- vale on -->

Where a proposal claims to handle a set of cases, prove it with a worked example
per case, including the pathological one.

### Code is for developer experience

Design documents aren't the place to sketch how the code works inside. Leave out
Go or Python unless the code is itself the design, as with a library API, an SDK,
or a developer experience where what the user writes is the thing being designed.

Show code where the argument concerns how something would feel to use. Leave it
out where it would only illustrate the innards of a controller or a reconciler.
Those belong in the repo.

### Alternatives are honest

Give each alternative a fair hearing. Say what it is, what's good about it, then
why the proposal beats it, without resorting to strawmen. This applies doubly
where the alternative is the current system.

Alternatives earn their place. Not every discarded idea needs an entry, and a
low-value one is better deleted. Keep entries roughly the same length as each
other.

## Rhetorical patterns

### Build the case before the proposal

Structure the document so the reader reaches the proposal already understanding
the problem. By the time they hit "I propose…", it should feel like the natural
next step.

### Acknowledge trade-offs

Don't pretend the proposal is perfect. Name the downsides:

> The (big?) trade-off is that the better the upstream UX gets, the less
> compelling our proprietary lazy-loading feature is.

### Use concrete numbers

Prefer specific numbers to vague claims:

> 90 superfluous CRDs × 1.75 MB = 157.5 MB of API server memory. That's not so
> bad for one control plane, but across 10 control planes it's 1.5GB of wasted
> memory.

Every number has to be real, and traceable to something you measured or read.
The number above comes from a measured CRD size. A plausible figure invented to
make a paragraph concrete is the worst kind of fabrication, because its precision
is what makes the reader trust it. Where you don't have a number, describe the
effect and say you haven't measured it. Never estimate hardware costs, latencies,
or utilisation rates to strengthen an argument.

### Respect what came before

Assume whoever designed the previous system did the best they could with what
they knew, and assume they're reading this. Catalogue concrete shortcomings
("the ingestion pipeline adds substantial machinery for a debugging tool")
without calling the old system bad or broken. Focus on what changed, meaning new
requirements or constraints, that makes the old approach a poor fit now. Explain
why it's time to move on rather than belittling the past.

### Address skeptics directly

Anticipate objections and answer them inline. Name the likely objection in the
reader's voice, take it seriously, then answer it. Vary how you introduce it,
rather than repeating one formula.

Note the boundary with reactive framing in SKILL.md. Answering an objection a
reader would independently raise is good. Rewriting a section to argue with a
reviewer who already raised one is not.

### Frame decisions as preferences

"I'd prefer…", "I lean toward…", "I don't feel very strongly" signal confidence
in the reasoning without shutting down discussion.

Where a choice was forced rather than preferred, say that instead. Traefik isn't
a favourite. It's the only thing meeting the requirements today, and framing it
as a preference misleads.

### Reference prior art

Link to and summarise relevant prior work: upstream issues, old design docs,
community discussions, conference talks. Show awareness of a problem's history.

Link outward, generously. Don't link to issues or PRs in the same repo, for the
reasons in SKILL.md.

## Formatting

### Paragraphs and flow

Write flowing paragraphs rather than bullet-heavy outlines. Use bullets for lists
of concrete items such as API fields, workstreams, or goals, and prefer prose for
reasoning and narrative. Paragraphs run three to six sentences.

### Headings

Use descriptive headings. "Namespace Composite Resources" beats "Proposal Item
1". H2 for major sections, H3 for subsections, applied consistently.

### Code and YAML examples

Include examples inline where they clarify the proposal. Add brief comments where
semantics aren't obvious. Keep examples focused, trimming irrelevant fields with
`# Omitted for brevity`. Show whole objects rather than fragments, and reuse
tested manifests from the repo.

### Links

Use inline links in prose, or reference-style links at the bottom for upstream
design docs. Make issue references real URLs, since a bare `#34` doesn't resolve
in a repo markdown file.
